# Task Overview

This assessment involves an Express.js API written in TypeScript with several middlewares that extend the request object to include user-specific information. After a middleware refactor that introduced type aliases and generics, the API began to fail: route handlers no longer recognize the custom properties added by the middleware, resulting in both TypeScript compile-time errors and runtime issues when properties like 'profile' and 'session' are accessed. Your task is to restore proper type propagation so TypeScript is aware of these request augmentations and the API routes function both at compile and runtime.

# Guidance

The project consists of a TypeScript-based Express API that attaches user and session details to the request in middleware. Due to changes in how types are declared or propagated, downstream route handlers are no longer type-safe, and the application encounters errors. Your focus should be on ensuring that TypeScript understands these request enhancements throughout the middleware pipeline, which may require proper use of module augmentation or TypeScript generics. Ensure strict type checks are enforced.

# Objectives

Restore compile-time and runtime safety so that route handlers can reliably and type-safely access any custom properties that the middleware attaches to the request object, such as 'profile' and 'session'. The API must build under strict TypeScript settings and return valid responses at runtime when its endpoints are called.

# How to Verify

Confirm that the codebase compiles without TypeScript errors related to custom request properties. Start the application and test the relevant API endpoint to ensure both the server and TypeScript recognize the presence of middleware-extended request properties. The API should respond with user and session information, and runtime crashes due to missing properties should be eliminated.
